I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at Louisiana State University (LSU), where I research modern and emerging machine learning techniques, with applications to national security, especially cybersecurity. I also hold joint appointments with the LSU Center for Computation and Technology (CCT) and the LSU Office of Academic Affairs (OAA). Prior to LSU, I was a staff research data scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), where I led research efforts to develop applied deep learning and neuromorphic computing approaches for federal sponsors. Recently, my work has been centered around transformer technology and Large Language Model (LLM) research. This focus includes implementing these models in security-related applications, as well as investigating the security and potential security vulnerabilities within LLM 
systems themselves. At LSU, I teach a course on LLMs for undergraduate upperclassman and am developing a graduate-level deep learning course focusing on transformers and other emerging deep learning architectures. Throughout my education and career, I have developed a strong passion for neuromorphic computing, applied deep learning, and machine learning-enabled sensing.
