I am a senior research scientist with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Stephenson Disaster Management Institute (SDMI). I am leading a new research program within SDMI that focuses on emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to national security, homeland security, and emergency response. I also develop large language models for improving the efficiency of business operations dealing with natural language processing tasks. I began my career with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as a research data scientist in the Advanced Radiation Detection, Imaging, Data Science, and Applications (ARDIDSA) group. Throughout my education and career, I have developed a strong passion for neuromorphic computing, applied deep learning, and machine learning-enabled sensing.
