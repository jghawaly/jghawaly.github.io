Abstract:

In this work, we introduce ForensicLLM, a 4-bit quantized LLaMA-3.1-8B model fine-tuned on Q&A samples extracted from digital forensic research articles and curated digital artifacts. We evaluate the model's performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively, against standard RAG and base-model performance.
