Hello! I am James Ghawaly, a senior research scientist with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Stephenson Disaster Management Institute (SDMI). I am leading a new research program within SDMI that focuses on emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to national security, homeland security, and disaster management. I am a nuclear and computer engineer by training, having since focused on three primary areas of research through my education and following career - deep learning, neuromorphic computing, and radiation detection. After graduating with my PhD at The University of Tennessee Knoxville, I joined the Advanced Radiation Detection, Imaging, Data Science, and Applications (ARDIDSA) group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as a data scientist on the research professional track. While most of my research has been applied, I am deeply interested in fundamental research in deep learning and biologically-inspired neuromorphic computing.
